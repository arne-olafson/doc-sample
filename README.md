## What you will find:

I updated my resume to include Lando among other things, since it is my new favourite local.  I have included a couple of files to show my familiarity with Drupal 8.  I included the video twig file because it did cool stuff when it was passed to the client, but it does not seem like they ended up using it.  The cards file shows a solution for images uploaded by regular users.

* [Greensock animation](https://olafson.ca/icons.html) - A simple svg morph and text animation, unfinished.
* [Card display](https://r.umn.edu/admissions) - Endpoint for the node--content-card.html.twig file.  The request was for the image to change aspect ratio as the screen width reduces to mobile.  I applied background-size: cover; to the media as a background image to accommodate the request, the only caveat is that the uploaded image needs to have good content top center.  I added this instruction to the user in the field description.  Unfortunately for the client, in the meantime this field display has been changed to a poorly-scaled media style, resulting in large files being sent to the user's browser.
